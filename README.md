**SESSION ABSTRACT**      
After this talk you will know all there is to know about End-to-End Test Automation.   Starting with the basics and comparison to Unit Testing, we shall will drill down into what is considered uncharted territory for many developers.    You will learn the best practises and design patterns, common pitfalls, and most importantly, the full ecosystem and how it connects to your existing toolchain. You will learn on different approaches to UI verifications, and see real industry use cases and bugs. This talk will dive into Selenium, the most commonly used Open Source library, but will overview many frameworks and tools, both free and commercial.

**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION- for committee's review eyes only**      
End-To-End testing is the only real way to confirm that your app is safe from bugs.
This talk will give the users all the information a developer needs to start automating real end-2-end tests.
This includes:
 * What's the advantages compared to unit-tests (and
answer dev's question: I've unit testing my code for years,
and have lectured plenty of all frameworks).
 * Explain the the best design patterns (I've lectured on how
to use the Page Object and Page Factory correctly in the
Selenium World Summit).
 * Where do the tests run (locally or CI)
# Where are the browsers run (local, local-grid, commercial
browser-in-the-cloud grids, and open source frameworks).
 * What it differs from unit tests (including common pitfalls
for experienced unit-tester).
 * How to do real UI testing and check the pixels and not just
DOM abstractions (overview free/open-sourced and commercial tools).
